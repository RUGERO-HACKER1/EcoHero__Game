# Waste Warrior — Clean the City

Minimal Expo-managed React Native scaffold for the Game Jam project.

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd C:\Game
npm install
npx expo start
# then press 'a' to open Android emulator or use Expo Go on device
```

This workspace contains a simple playable `Game` screen (player move, trash spawn, sorting, pollution bar).

Next steps:
- Install dependencies
- Run `npx expo start` and test on Android / Expo Go
- Replace placeholder assets in `assets/` and iterate
