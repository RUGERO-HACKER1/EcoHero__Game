Place your sound files here:
- pick.mp3 — pickup sound
- correct.mp3 — correct disposal
- wrong.mp3 — wrong disposal
- background.mp3 — background music (REQUIRED for music during gameplay)

You can download free SFX from freesound.org or Kenney audio packs.
For background music, you can use royalty-free music from:
- Incompetech (incompetech.com)
- Free Music Archive (freemusicarchive.org)
- YouTube Audio Library
- OpenGameArt.org

IMPORTANT: To enable background music:
1. Add a file named "background.mp3" to this folder (assets/sounds/)
2. The music will automatically play and loop during gameplay
3. Music volume is set to 25% so it doesn't overpower game sounds
